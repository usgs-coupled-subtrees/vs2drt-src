"""
    Helper module for generating a YAML file for 
    initializing a PhreeqcRM instance. The YAML
    file is likely to be written by a GUI or preprocessor,
    and the PhreeqcRM method InitializeYAML can be 
    used to execute the methods recorded in the YAML
    file to set properties and initial conditions in
    the PhreeqcRM instance.

    Functions that accept a constant vector reference
    (const std::vector<double>&) should be callable
    with any of the three Python data types, namely
    np.ndarray, list, and tuple.

    For example, the porosity can be initialized:

    # numpy.ndarray
    porosity = np.full((nxyz,), 0.2)

    # list (using list repetition)
    porosity = [0.2] * nxyz

    # list (using list comprehension)
    porosity = [0.2 for i in range(nxyz)]

    # tuple (using a generator expression)
    porosity = tuple(0.2 for i in range(nxyz))

    # And used:
    nxyz = 20
    nthreads = 3
    phreeqc_rm = phreeqcrm.PhreeqcRM(nxyz, nthreads)
    status = phreeqc_rm.SetPorosity(porosity)

    # likewise for integers (const std::vector<int>&)

    Currently functions that take non-const vectors (ie OUT or INOUT)
    must use the SWIG wrapped vector class like this:

    c_dbl_vect = phreeqcrm.DoubleVector(nxyz * len(components))
    status = phreeqc_rm.GetConcentrations(c_dbl_vect)

        This method can be called multiple times and the list that is created is cummulative.

        alternatively, the list may be set to contain total H and total O (YAMLSetComponentH2O),

        adjusts the calculated optimum number of cell transfers by a fraction from 0 to 1.0 to
        determine the actual number of cell transfers. A value of zero eliminates load rebalancing. 
        A value less than 1.0 is suggested to slow the approach to the optimum cell distribution and

        reverse transfers at the next iteration. Default is 0.5.

        volume (default), whereas transport models that assume constant-density flow will probably use
        specified values of density and solution volume. Only the following databases distributed with 
        PhreeqcRM have molar-volume information needed to accurately calculate density and solution
